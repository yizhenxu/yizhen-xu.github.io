### Research interests

My research work has the overarching theme of developing novel statistical ensemble learningand causal inference methods with applications to electronic health records to investigate epidemiological and clinical problems related to public health policies and clinical practices. My work has primarily focused on causal inference, Bayesian latent variable models, ensemble methods, and longitudinal data analysis, with applications in infectious and chronic diseases such as HIV, Scleroderma, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and SARS-CoV-2.
